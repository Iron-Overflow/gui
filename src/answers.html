              <p>I'm trying to understand GHC.TypeLits, and specifically someNatVal. I understand the way it's used in this blog post here, but as mentioned the same example could have been implemented using natVal, like:

isLength :: forall len a. KnownNat len => Integer -> List len a -> Bool
isLength n _ = n == natVal (Proxy :: Proxy len)
Are there any uses of someNatVal that can't be rewritten with natVal?</p>

                <p>The main use of someNatVal is using a value at run time as if it was a type that wasn't known at compile time.

  My answer to Can I have an unknown KnownNat? provides a really dumb example. There are a million better ways to write a program that does the same thing as that one. But it shows what someNatVal does. It's essentially a function from value to type - with an existential limiting the scope of that type to places where it's not statically known.</p>
